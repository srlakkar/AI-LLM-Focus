    "# **Text Chunking Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Document splitting or Text chunking is a critical preprocessing step in machine learning and NLP tasks. It involves breaking down large text documents into smaller, manageable pieces (chunks) for downstream tasks."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## **Why split documents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensuring Consistent Processing:** Documents in real-world datasets rarely follow a uniform length. Some may be a few sentences long, while others span multiple pages. Splitting them into manageable chunks ensures that all documents are processed consistently, regardless of their original size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Working Within Model Constraints:** Most language models and embedding models have a limit on the number of tokens they can process at once. If a document exceeds this limit, it needs to be truncated or split. Chunking prevents information loss by allowing long documents to be processed in full, section by section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Improving Representation and Understanding:** When dealing with long texts, embeddings and model representations may become diluted, struggling to capture key details effectively. By breaking a document into smaller segments, each part can retain a clearer and more focused representation, leading to better downstream performance in tasks like retrieval and summarization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Enhancing Search and Retrieval Accuracy:** In search systems, retrieving an entire document in response to a query isn’t always helpful. Instead, chunking allows for more precise matching, so that users get results at a finer granularity—directly pointing them to the most relevant passage rather than the whole document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimizing Memory and Computation:** Processing large texts as a whole can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Splitting them into smaller chunks enables better parallelization, reduces memory overhead, and speeds up processing, making it more efficient for both training and inference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking is essential for maintaining both accuracy and efficiency when working with textual data. It not only ensures smooth processing but also enhances the quality of results in applications like search engines, chatbots, and summarization systems.  \n"

Leaders of the American Revolution were colonial separatist leaders who originally sought more autonomy as British subjects, but later assembled to support the Revolutionary War, which ended British colonial rule over the colonies, establishing their independence as the United States of America in July 1776.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discontent with colonial rule began shortly after the defeat of France in the French and Indian War in 1763. Although the colonies had fought and supported the war, Parliament imposed new taxes to compensate for wartime costs and turned control of the colonies' western lands over to the British officials in Montreal. Representatives from several colonies convened the Stamp Act Congress; its \"Declaration of Rights and Grievances\" argued that taxation without representation violated their rights as Englishmen. In 1767, tensions flared again following the British Parliament's passage of the Townshend Acts. In an effort to quell the mounting rebellion, King George III deployed troops to Boston. A local confrontation resulted in the troops killing protesters in the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. In 1772, anti-tax demonstrators in Rhode Island destroyed the Royal Navy customs schooner Gaspee. On December 16, 1773, activists disguised as Indians instigated the Boston Tea Party and dumped chests of tea owned by the British East India Company into Boston Harbor. London closed Boston Harbor and enacted a series of punitive laws, which effectively ended self-government in Massachusetts.\n",

It began coordinating Patriot resistance through underground networks of committees. In April 1775, British forces attempted to disarm local militias around Boston and engaged them. On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress responded by authorizing formation of the Continental Army and appointing George Washington as its commander-in-chief. In August, the king proclaimed Massachusetts to be in a state of open defiance and rebellion. The Continental Army surrounded Boston, and the British withdrew by sea in March 1776, leaving the Patriots in control in every colony. In July 1776, the Second Continental Congress began to take on the role of governing a new nation. It passed the Lee Resolution for national independence on July 2, and on July 4, 1776, unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which embodied the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism, rejected monarchy and aristocracy, and famously proclaimed that \"all men are created equal\".\n",

The defeat led to the collapse of King George's control of Parliament, with a majority now in favor of ending the war on American terms. On September 3, 1783, the British signed the Treaty of Paris, granting the United States nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes.

Leaders of the American Revolution were colonial separatist leaders who originally sought more autonomy as British subjects, but later assembled to support the Revolutionary War, which ended British colonial rule over the colonies, establishing their independence as the United States of America in July 1776.\n",

      "Discontent with colonial rule began shortly after the defeat of France in the French and Indian War in 1763. Although the colonies had fought and supported the war, Parliament imposed new taxes to compensate for wartime costs and turned control of the colonies' western lands over to the British officials in Montreal. Representatives from several colonies convened the Stamp Act Congress; its \"Declaration of Rights and Grievances\" argued that taxation without representation violated their rights as Englishmen. In 1767, tensions flared again following the British Parliament's passage of the Townshend Acts. In an effort to quell the mounting rebellion, King George III deployed troops to Boston. A local confrontation resulted in the troops killing protesters in the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. In 1772, anti-tax demonstrators in Rhode Island destroyed the Royal Navy customs schooner Gaspee.\n",

      "In late 1774, 12 of the Thirteen Colonies (Georgia joined in 1775) sent delegates to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. It began coordinating Patriot resistance through underground networks of committees. In April 1775, British forces attempted to disarm local militias around Boston and engaged them. On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress responded by authorizing formation of the Continental Army and appointing George Washington as its commander-in-chief. In August, the king proclaimed Massachusetts to be in a state of open defiance and rebellion. The Continental Army surrounded Boston, and the British withdrew by sea in March 1776, leaving the Patriots in control in every colony. In July 1776, the Second Continental Congress began to take on the role of governing a new nation. It passed the Lee Resolution for national independence on July 2, and on July 4, 1776, unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which embodied the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism, rejected monarchy and aristocracy, and famously proclaimed that \"all men are created equal\".\n",

The defeat led to the collapse of King George's control of Parliament, with a majority now in favor of ending the war on American terms. On September 3, 1783, the British signed the Treaty of Paris, granting the United States nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes. About 60,000 Loyalists migrated to other British territories in Canada and elsewhere, but the great majority remained in the United States.
