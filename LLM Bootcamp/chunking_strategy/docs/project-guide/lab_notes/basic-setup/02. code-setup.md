# Setting up the Development Environment

1. `cd <my_project>` (to get into your current project)
2. `uv sync` (this will use the `pyproject.toml` to generate a `.venv` and `uv.lock` file which has the dependencies installed in your .venv)
3. `uv run <python_code.py>` (instead of `python <python_code.py>` that one normally runs inside a virtual environment) - this will internally run the python code inside the `.venv` environment.  So there is no need to do a `source .venv/bin/activate` to get into an environment before running a python code now.  Note that we could have done `uv run <python_code.py>` without having a virtual environment (`.venv`) also.  It would automatically do a `uv sync` internally to generate a `uv.lock` and `.venv` before running the python code in the virtual environment.
4. `uv add <package_lib>` (this will add a package to `pyproject.toml`, followed by doing a`uv sync` to update dependencies in the virtual environment including update of `uv.lock`)
5. `uv remove <package_lib>` (same as above to remove a package)
6. `uv lock` (this will only update the uv.lock file with dependencies based on `pyproject.toml` without updating dependencies in the `.venv`, whereas `uv sync` updates `uv.lock` as well as updates dependencies.)
7. Instead of using `uv add <package>` or `uv remove <package>`, we could directly update `pyproject.toml` also.
8. `uv build` (to build the wheel file)
9. In VS Code, choose the virtual environment by going through the Command Pallette.  Likewise choose the kernel when opening a jupyter notebook as the appropriate virtual environment.
