# UV Setup Instructions

1. `conda deactivate` (to get out of base `conda` environment) - we could remove `conda` specific commands from `.bashrc` but if there are other projects using `conda` we can leave it.

2. `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` (to install `uv` locally.  You would also need to update the `$PATH` in your .bashrc to include the local folder where `uv` got installed)
