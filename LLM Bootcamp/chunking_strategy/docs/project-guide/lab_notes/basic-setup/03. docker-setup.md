# Docker setup

Docker needs to be setup on your machine for running many of the examples throughout this course.  If you are on Rocky Linux, you may already have `podman` installed.  If so, we would recommend that you uninstall `podman` (can be done by issuing a `sudo dnf remove podman` command).

The following are the steps needed for installing Docker:

```bash
# Add docker repo
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

# Install docker-ce, docker-ce-cli, containerd.io, docker-compose-plugin
sudo dnf -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

# Start docker as a system process
sudo systemctl --now enable docker

# Add current user to the docker group so that he/she can issue docker commands without sudo
sudo usermod -a -G docker $(whoami)

# Add other users to the docker group so they can issue docker commands without sudo
sudo usermod -a -G docker custom-user
```

A brief description of the various components of Docker are as below:

1. `docker-ce`               : This package provides the underlying technology for building and running docker containers (dockerd) 
2. `docker-ce-cli`           : Provides the command line interface (CLI) client docker tool (docker)
3. `containerd.io`           : Provides the container runtime (runc)
4. `docker-compose-plugin`   : A plugin that provides the 'docker compose' subcommand
